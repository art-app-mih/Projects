My projects

Here I posted my mini-projects:

1. Project number 3 stores a script written in Python. It is written to take part in the Kaggle demolitions. And predicts the winner of the online game "Dota 2" in 5 minutes.

2. This is a script with which I competed in kaggle competitions for recognizing dirty and clean dishes using computer vision (https://www.kaggle.com/c/platesv2/). This script is written on Python too. I used the CNN architecture (specifically ResNet50) and the Pytorch framework.

3. The fifth project I did in the field of computer vision. It is dedicated to the recognition of models of various types of cars.

4. In projects that start with metrics-..., I implemented a client program to send metrics to the server, as well as a server that accepts these metrics
