My projects

Here I posted my projects:

1. In the first project, which is called "Base code", there is a script of my bachelor's work. The topic is automatic recognition of the speakerâ€™s emotional state by voice. In it, I created a recognition algorithm based on the nerve network - an auto-encoder with an output softmax layer. The script is written in Matlab.

2. In a project called CalmXpert, a graphical user interface is implemented to demount the recognition algorithm in real time. The script is written in Matlab too.

3. Project number 3 stores a script written in Python. It is written to take part in the Kaggle demolitions. And predicts the winner of the online game "Dota 2" in 5 minutes.
