My projects

Here I posted my mini-projects:

1. In the project "price forecasting", I conducted a detailed analysis of data to predict real estate prices in Moscow. 

2. Project "Final_project" includes a script written in Python. It is written to take part in the Kaggle demolitions. And predicts the winner of the online game "Dota 2" in 5 minutes.

3. This is a script with which I competed in kaggle competitions for recognizing dirty and clean dishes using computer vision (https://www.kaggle.com/c/platesv2/). This script is written on Python too. I used the CNN architecture (specifically ResNet50) and the Pytorch framework.

4. The fifth project I did in the field of computer vision. It is dedicated to the recognition of models of various types of cars (also used transfer learning with ResNet50).

5. In projects that start with metrics-..., I implemented a client program to send metrics to the server, as well as a server that accepts these metrics/

6. Another (MyBot.py) project is a telegram bot that remembers visited places.

7. vae_total.py is script, which extract features from data using Variational Autoencoder (VAE was written use Keras).
